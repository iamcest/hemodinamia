NOTES:

   All Key elements are collected from various sources as  Papers,
      Registries(CathPci, Action, Impact, etc), HL7 Version 3.


  I cannot claim that it is fully  standard-compliant

  The Coronary Artery Graphics and the Bull's Eye are based upon  assumptions.
  Thus  their precision  can be questioned.
  Clinical Decisions based on this Graphics should not be made.

  The Vessels are drawn as paths with inkscape (ugly).
  The Number of variations in large patient cohorts is ~500.
  I draw a small subset of them


  Before to use it Please verify the accuracy and/or usefulness.
    Correct - update - Change any disagreements in definitions and controlled vocabularies to suite your needs.

HISTORY:

=====================
Many years ago it was written
      ( by Suzanne Knoebel - Databases in Cardiology Kluwer Academic Publishers - 1991)

  Element definitions and adherence to those definitions is the most difficult part
  observational database analyses
  When does a acute myocardial Infarction become  a recent myocardial infarction?
  When does a recent myocardial Infarction become a post myocardial infarction?
  When a Emergent procedure become a semi-emergent procedure?
  What criteria indicate a congestive heart failure?
------------------------------------
  Data Definition is not a easy task
----------------------------------


  Recently Data definitions for cardiology started to be published in the
    Relevant academic journals.

   As is stressed   "Without data standards and controlled vocabulary
   we are lost in the age of computers and networks!"

    There does not yet exist in the United States, Europe, or elsewhere a robust and sustainable
    unifying infrastructure that spans the entire translational research, clinical research, regulatory,
    and clinical practice continuum. ( 2013 Ref: 9)


  The specific goals of clinical data standards are as it is described (Ref 1):

  1. To establish a consistent, interoperable, and universal
   clinical vocabulary as a foundation for both clinical care
   and clinical research.

  2. To promote the ubiquitous use of EHRs (Electronic Health Records) and facilitate the
   exchange of data across systems through harmonized,
   standardized definitions of key data elements.

  3. To facilitate the further development of clinical registries,
   quality- and performance-improvement programs, out comes evaluations,
   and clinical research, including the  comparison of results
   within and across these initiatives.

  4. To produce structured Reports. The reasoning of producing structured reports is explained from  the statements:

      The ACC- and SCAI-endorsed Accreditation for  Cardiovascular Excellence
      program (www.cvexcel.org)  specifies the generation of structured reports as a criterion for accreditation, similar to criteria established by the  respective Intersocietal Commissions in echo cardiadiography, nuclear cardiology, and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging
      (www.intersocietal.org).



  5 Controlled vocabularies are selected lists of words and phrases
        (standardized data elements) with explicit definitions  that convey specific
        (human interpretable) meaning while achieving computational interoperability.


  Enjoy
 Profit !!
